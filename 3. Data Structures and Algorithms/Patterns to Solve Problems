==> Sliding Window and Two Pointers

Work on the 4 patterns.

1. Constant window.
2. Longest Subarray/Substring with condition (Brute Force,Better,Optimal).
3. No. of subarrays where condition (we will use pattern 2 here ).
4. Minimum Window Subsequence. 

Problems to Solve :

1. Longest Subarray with sum<=k (Basic Problem to understand Pattern 2).
2. Longest Substring without repeating characters.
3. Maximum Consecutive Ones 111.
4. Fruits into Basket.
5. Longest Repeating Character Replacement.
6. Binary Subarray with Sum.
7. Count number of nice subarrays.
8. Number of substring containing all three characters.
9. Maximum point you can obtain from cards.
10. Longest substring with atmost k Distinc characters.
11. Subarray with K different integers.
12. Minimum Window Substring.
13. Minimum Window Subsequence (Pattern 4).
